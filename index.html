							<p>I'm Lynn Houston and I've lived in Miloli'i for 11 years. I've seen our associations needs change over time. Roads are paved now, and there is a process in place for collecting unpaid dues. There should be new priorities, such as less expensive options for association management. I am a former board member, and I'd like to have open meetings again, to be able to discuss different opinions. Please consider giving your vote to individual board members or submitting your proxy for quorum only. Giving your proxy to the board as whole perpetuates a single point of view.</p>

The various aspects of those positions allowed me to learn a great deal in running a successful business, as well :is giving me insight to working with people in a positive and respectful manner. As our community continues to grow, we all will be faced with new changes and challenges. I want to be able to assist in making constructive and good decisions for our community. A change in leadership can be difficult, but it can work for the good of all.</p>

My observations of last year's annual meeting and elections established that the 2014-2017 elections were all invalid. I was subsequently removed as a board director. If an accountable, legal board election can be performed this year, I would appreciate the opportunity to serve again and continue my attempt to conduct board meetings with membership participation. Transparency can prevent another incident of this magnitude and save us from potential costly liability of illegal actions.</p>

		            <p class="blog-post-meta">Feb 17 2018 by <a href="#">Paul Cox</a></p>

		            <p>It has come to light that all but 1 of the elections held in the last 10 years were illegal.</p>
		            <hr>
		            <p>According to the Association's own attorney who reviewed the Board's practices against State Law:</p>
		            <blockquote class="offset">
						<p>
							...the proxy forms that were sent out to the membership for their voting in the years 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 inadvertantly failed to include the box for members of the Association to give their proxy to the members of the Board of Directors present at the meeting "<b>with the vote to be shared with each board member receiving an equal percentage</b>"
						</p>
						<p>
							...The statutes are very clear that for a proxy to be valid it must comply with the statuatory requirements. If it does not, it is an invalid proxy. All of the proxies returned for use in the 2014-2017 elections failed, even if inadvertently, to include all of the statuatory requirements, therefore <b>all</b> proxies utilized for those elections are deemed invalid.
