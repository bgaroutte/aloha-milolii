				</div>

		        <div class="blog-post">
		            <p>Aloha, fellow MBCAII members!</p>
					<p>
					A group of us -- long-term residents, new property owners, and former board members -- urge you to pay special attention to this year's annual election.   Many of us have lived here full time for many years and may have a perspective that you find valuable.
					</p>
					 
					<p>
					We appreciate the work the board outlined in their mailer dated 2/15/18. A person who gives of their time and energy without compensation deserves appreciation. We thank those that have served.
					</p> 
					 
					<p>
					<b>What the board letter does not reveal is that the board received a <a href="includes/docs/bob-doc.pdf" target="_blank">legal opinion dated 1/17/18</a> that invalidated the elections they held for the last 4 years.</b>  Proxies have been malformed continuously. We have included this legal opinion that the board received, but failed to share with its membership. There are multiple possibilities, some intentional and some not, why a change was made to the proxy in 2014.  The result of the change enhanced the board's significant power to determine the results of the election of directors and the assessment of dues.
					</p>
					 
					<p>
					<b>Distant owners may not grasp the culture of the management and the present board.</b>   There is a list of fine people who feel that they have been either pushed out, forced out, or chose to leave their board seat because their opinions were not always in harmony with management and the board members who regularly agree with management. 
					</p>
					 
					<p>
					Paul Cox is one of these people. Paul was appointed to a vacant position.  His position was confirmed by membership in the elections held after his appointment. Paul has devoted himself to understanding the laws of Hawaii as they relate to homeowners associations. Through his efforts, he brought notice of the malformed proxies to the HOA board. The result? He was told his position on the board was invalid, and he was no longer seated. Since then, two other people have been appointed to the board.  How is that possible? 
					</p>
					 
					<p>
					We appreciate Paul for identifying this liability. His efforts protect us all.  He should be elevated on the board...not removed.  <b>Take a moment to consider that a legally invalid board has filed liens, foreclosed on property and authorized significant expenses.</b>
					</p>
					 
					<p>
					The letter also does not make mention of the extensive use of “executive sessions” by the current board. “Executive sessions” are meetings in secret without public minutes. We have learned that the last 18 months of meetings have all been in executive sessions. This lack of transparency is troubling to us and should be to you. <b>Do you realize that the board just created rules that affect every owner and every property without any open conversation with the membership?</b> They met in “executive session” without public comment or published minutes of their meetings. This is unacceptable.
					</p>
					 
					  
					<p>
					The board letter dated 2/15/18 asks you to “Fill out your proxy naming the Majority of the Board”. <b>Please don't</b>. Because the majority of proxies are assigned to the board, the board has been static and self-perpetuating. It has been virtually impossible to be seated on the board without being selected by the board itself.  We need your help to increase the diversity of opinion on the board.
					</p> 
					 
					<p>
					We ask instead that you work with us to elect a board that has a clear commitment to transparency through open meetings, works to engage the membership in decision making, respects and welcomes different opinions and keeps membership safer by cautious adherence to legal election procedures.
					</p>
					 
					<p>
					Because you cannot vote without being present, we ask that you give your proxy to one of the candidates listed below.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Paul Cox</b></li>
						<li><b>Armando Cruz</b></li>
						<li><b>Lynne Houston</b></li> 
						<li><b>Kathy Kuharski</b></li> 
						<li><b>Pam McBride</b></li> 
						<li><b>Oscar Salgado</b></li> 
						<li><b>Dr. Patricia Mullen</b></li>
					</ul>
					 
					<p>
					If you do not want to support these candidates individually, at a minimum, please check the proxy box that says, "<b>For quorum purposes only</b>".  This will allow the meeting to be held, all voices to be heard, and all votes to be counted fairly.

								<p>Paul Cox, full-time resident, retired peace officer. Serving the community as the Civil Defense. Lead  for  Miloli'i  and participant  in Miloli'i's subsistence fishery application. My observations of last year's annual meeting and elections established that the 2014-2017 elections were all invalid. I was subsequently removed as a board director. If an accountable, legal board election can be performed this year, I would appreciate the opportunity to serve again and continue my attempt to conduct board meetings with membership participation. Transparency can prevent another incident of this magnitude and save us from potential costly liability of illegal actions.</p>

								<p>I would like to run for board member for 2018-2019. I have been a homeowner since 2010. I would like to work with others on the current and future issues that involve the health, safety and happiness of our neighborhood. As we grow and new challenges arise, I believe that more of us should participate in our local communities to bring in new ideas and build on the strongest foundation possible.</p>

I am able to listen calmly and ask clarifying questions.  I help people decide on feasible goals and create realistic action plans.  I then problem-solve barriers while maintaining accountability.

								<h5>Lynn Houston</h5>
								<p>I'm Lynn Houston and I've lived in Miloli'i for 11 years. I've seen our associations needs change over time. Roads are paved now, and there is a process in place for collecting unpaid dues. There should be new priorities, such as less expensive options for association management. I am a former board member, and I'd like to have open meetings again, to be able to discuss different opinions. Please consider giving your vote to individual board members or submitting your proxy for quorum only. Giving your proxy to the board as whole perpetuates a single point of view.</p>

								<p>I have owned property in Miloli'i for 23 years and this past year I built, retired and moved into the community. My professional career primarily consisted of retail management positions. The various aspects of those positions allowed me to learn a great deal in running a successful business, as well :is giving me insight to working with people in a positive and respectful manner. As our community continues to grow, we all will be faced with new changes and challenges. I want to be able to assist in making constructive and good decisions for our community. A change in leadership can be difficult, but it can work for the good of all.</p>
